## FAQ
Q: That thing does not start up \
A: Try to recompile the game yourself. Run ```./build.sh``` - bash script with g++ command.


Q: That thing prints weird symbols \
A: You are probably running windows. Special symbol that deletes the previous line doesn't work in cmd/powershell. I haven't fix this yet, but you can try to fix it yourself.
